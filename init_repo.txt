To Create a repo locally

1) Create a new folder for your project and add your files
2) git init     => To initialize a new repository
3) git status   => To see untracked/tracked changes
4) git add .     => To track changes of all files
5) git commit -m "<Title message>" -m "<description text>"    -> To commit the changes to the repo
6) Create a new empty repository in GitHub
7) git remote add origin "<Paste the link you get from GitHub new repo page>"     => To push the changes to the online repository. 
8) git push -u origin master  => Pushes the changes to the repo. -u specifies the upstream. This will be the branch that we push to by default.so we dont have to write master each time



Tips:

git branch => to see the branches in the repo
git checkout -b <name of the new branch>   => checkout is used to switch btw branches and -b is used to create a new branch. naming convention is upto you.
git diff <branch name>  => will display the changes between your current branch and the one you specified in the command. press enter to go line by line and press q to exit.

git push --set-upstream origin develop-readme-instructions  => To push the changes to the remote repository
or 
git push -u origin develop-readme-instructions => -u is the shorthand for --set-upstream. It is the same thing.


9) After performing the above steps, you need to create pull request from the feature branch to your main/master branch
10) git branch -d <feature branch name>  => Once done, you will need to delete the feature branch using this command. Because we don't normally use a feature branch once a pull req has been created
11) git pull origin master => This command will fetch the changes merged to master using the PR and will update the local master branch



<<<<<<< HEAD
Added new commands
git commit -am "<Commit Message>"   => This command will add and commit the changes with the message. It only works for modified files and does not work for newly created ones
